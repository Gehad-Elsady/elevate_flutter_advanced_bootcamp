# elevate_flutter_advanced_bootcamp

In this app I fetch the data from API First I use Postman to know what the response looks like to find how can I handle it I found that the response is a list of products each product has data like (title, price, and image)
the problem was to make the list as a model to show the data I fixed it and successfully showed the data I used in this app (bloc, API, RatingBarIndicator, and HTTPS) to get the data and handle it.
In the end thanks for considering my application to join Elevate Flutter bootcamp.
